째Project OverviewThis:

 -project revolves around the implementation of the Repository design pattern and adheres to SOLID principles. Additionally, it utilizes components in Laravel for enhanced modularization.

째Repository Design Pattern

-The project employs the Repository design pattern to separate the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage and the business logic that acts on the data. This separation enhances code maintainability and scalability.

째SOLID Principles

-The SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) are applied throughout the codebase. This ensures a flexible and robust architecture, making the system more adaptable to changes and easier to extend.

째Laravel Components

-Laravel components are leveraged to enhance the modularity of the system. Components encapsulate related functionality into easily manageable and reusable units, promoting a clean and organized codebase.Feel free to explore the codebase to understand how these design patterns and principles are implemented for a more efficient and maintainable project structure.
